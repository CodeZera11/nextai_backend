# NEXTAI_ASSIGNMENT BACKEND

## Local Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the `node_modules` folder.
3. Create a `.env` file and copy the environment variable names like in the `.env.example` file. To get these variables, you have to go to Google Cloud Console and create a new project to gain all the required client_id, secret, and API key.
4. Run the code using `npm run dev`.

That's it! You should now be able to run the project locally.
